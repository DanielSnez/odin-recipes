    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fast, easy, simple, delicious. Even a klutz like me can manage to make it in no time. It adds a whole lot of flavor to those every day eggs.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix water, soy sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add egg and beat until egg mixture is combined.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet over medium heat until a drop of water evaporates almost immediately. Pour egg mixture into pan. Cook until the bottom of the omelet has solidified, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and fold omelet into a square and transfer to a plate.</li>
